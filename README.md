# Project-Kind-Way
This is my first personal project that I built during my bootcamp in Enspiral Dev Academy, which I presented in week 6 of the bootcamp. This is a project to make people develop to become a better version of themselves which inspired by Raqib (one of the Angel in Islam belief) who always take a note for human who do good. 


To look at this work, these are the steps that you should do:
- Clone this repo
